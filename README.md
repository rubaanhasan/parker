The Parking Payment System is designed to revolutionize the parking experience by integrating license plate recognition technology for automated parking payments. This system aims to enhance convenience, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness while reducing the need for manual intervention. Key features include online prebooking, license plate recognition, data logging, payment calculation, QR code generation, and data visibility.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** Html, Css, Javascript, Bootstrap.

**Server:** NodeJS, Expressjs, MongoDB.

**Machine Learning:** Python and its libraries.

## Features

**1. Online Prebooking**: Users can prebook parking slots in advance to ensure availability at their desired date and time.

**2. License Plate Recognition**: The system automates entry and exit processes by recognizing vehicles through their license plates.

**3. Data Logging**: All parking transactions are securely logged, providing a comprehensive record of parking activities.
